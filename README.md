### Description

I was inspired by MobyDock (http://www.mobydock.tk/) and created this program which can be used to replace the taskbar. It’s based on DirectX 8 for VB and needs just a little few tweaks (transparent background and anti-aliasing for example) but because the lack of time I can’t finish my code. So feel free to download the code and finish it on your own with your customs features.

You need to create a folder called (“icons”) in App.Path and put some PNG-Files in it. For the screenshot I used a PNG set from http://www.rokey.net/ but you can add any 128x128 PNG files you want.
